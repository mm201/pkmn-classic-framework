        Pok&eacute; Classic Network is an unofficial replacement for the original Generation IV and V online services, re-enabling the GTS, Battle Videos, and more. It works with Wiimmfi for general-purpose NWFC emulation, and Kaeru WFC for SSL offloading. (Compatibility with AltWFC servers is not guaranteed.)<br><br>
        <span class="heading">HOW TO CONNECT:</span><br>
        To properly connect to this service, you need to change the DNS addresses for your connection to the ones below.<br><br>
        Primary DNS:<br><span class="dns">178.&emsp;62.&emsp;43.212</span><br>
        Secondary DNS:<br><span class="dns">&emsp;&emsp;0.&emsp;&emsp;0.&emsp;&emsp;0.&emsp;&emsp;0</span><br><br>
        The process for changing these settings differs by console. On the Nintendo DSi or a later console, you need to go to the "System Settings" in the console's home screen, and follow a console-specific process.<br><br>
        On the Nintendo DS or Nintendo DS Lite, you need to access these settings within the game. Go to the "Nintendo WFC Settings" option in your game's main menu, tap the big blue "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Settings" button, then tap on the connection you're using. You'll arrive at the "Connection Settings" panel.<br><br>
        Scroll to the bottom of the settings using the scrollbar, set "Auto-obtain DNS" to "No", then edit the "Primary DNS" and "Secondary DNS". Once you're done, tap "Save Settings". Tap the "Back" button twice, and you'll be back at the game's introductory sequence.<br><br>
        After completing these steps, you can start playing like normal, and you'll automatically be able to use the Wi-Fi features of your game.

            Concept for the feature list box:
            Visitors can select the generation they're using to find out which services can be used in their game's generation. This can serve multiple purposes:
            - Lets visitors know the full extent of their games' online capabilities (since the games don't lay this information out in one place)
            - Can be used to indicate feature progress; in other words, letting users know whether the feature is working or not
            - Can be used to provide links to information pages on how to use the service (since the games only offer vague text explanations)
            - It's also nice as just a cool decoration

    The service supports battles over WFC, but is there easily-accessible data for how many battles are taking place at once?
    The reason why I'm asking: In an image I found here (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokémon_Global_Link), the 2012 Global Link screenshot, I noticed a "VS". I figured that it would be good to have something aside from trades to fill the globe.

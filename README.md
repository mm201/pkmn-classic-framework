# Poké Classic Framework

http://pkmnclassic.net/

Poké Classic Framework is a replacement server and class library for Pokémon
Generations 4 and 5. Poké Classic Network is the name of the server itself.

## How to connect

AltWFC is configured to automatically direct you to my servers. Follow the
[instructions](https://github.com/polaris-/dwc_network_server_emulator/wiki) 
at their wiki to connect.

## What works

* GTS
* Battle Videos
* Dressup (PtHGSS)
* Box uploads (PtHGSS)
* Musical photos (BW1/2)
* Wi-Fi Battle Tower and Subway

Direct communications are handled by 
[AltWFC](https://github.com/polaris-/dwc_network_server_emulator) and are
outside the scope of this project. They work at the time of writing but 
haven't been tested that thoroughly.

## What doesn't

* Trainer Rankings (PtHGSS)
* Wi-Fi Plaza (PtHGSS)
* Game Sync
* Rating Battles / Competitions

## What's planned

* A much more awesome website
* Cheat detection
* Stat checking in a similar manner as Pokécheck
* Game Sync (I will need help with this!)

## How you can help

If there's something you want to see, the best thing is to discuss it with me
and prepare a pull request. You should also check for open issues marked
[Help Wanted](https://github.com/mm201/pkmnFoundations/labels/help%20wanted).
Not all of them require programming skill.

The most significant way you can help is simply by using it. The GTS is nothing
without users. Get on there and start trading!
